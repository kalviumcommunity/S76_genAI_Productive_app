🎬 Video Script: Productive Maker App – MERN Backend (5 mins)
Intro (0:00 – 0:30)
👋 Hi everyone!
Welcome to this walkthrough of the Productive Maker App – MERN Backend.
This is not just another backend project—it’s a learning journey into Generative AI prompting concepts.
We’ll explore how a simple MERN backend can teach us powerful techniques like zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, dynamic prompting, and more, all while maintaining practical tools like token logging and evaluation.

Vision & Tech Overview (0:30 – 1:00)
The app is built with the MERN stack – MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
But here, the backend is the engine: it handles prompt creation, token usage, and performance testing.

The goal is two-fold:

Teach prompt engineering concepts in a hands-on way.

Show how to apply them in real applications—for AI-powered productivity tools.

System vs User Prompts (1:00 – 1:30)
Every interaction starts with two roles:

System prompts: rules and structure for the AI.

User prompts: the actual tasks or queries.

In our backend, these are stored in MongoDB and fetched via Express routes.
👉 This separation ensures control and consistency of AI responses.

Prompting Techniques (1:30 – 3:30)
Zero-shot (1:30 – 1:50)
AI responds with no prior examples. Perfect for open-ended queries.
Our API lets you send raw questions and log model output.

One-shot (1:50 – 2:10)
Provides one guiding example along with the user query.
This makes responses more aligned with specific tasks.

Multi-shot (2:10 – 2:30)
Supplies multiple examples, boosting accuracy and consistency.
Stored examples are retrieved and combined into the request payload.

Dynamic Prompting (2:30 – 2:50)
Prompts aren’t static—they adapt to user context or live data.
Example: building prompts based on real-time user inputs or external APIs.

Chain-of-Thought (2:50 – 3:30)
Instead of jumping to an answer, the backend simulates step-by-step reasoning internally, leading to more accurate responses.
This models how the AI can “think before it speaks.”

Evaluation & Token Tracking (3:30 – 4:30)
Evaluation Dataset & Testing:
We include a dataset of test prompts (like dataset.jsonl) and a runner script that checks whether outputs match expectations.
👉 This ensures the backend isn’t just functional but also measurable.

Tokenization & Logging:
Since every request consumes tokens, the backend counts and logs them.
Why? Because in real-world AI apps, usage = cost.
This feature allows cost monitoring, performance analysis, and optimization over time.

Implementation Flow (4:30 – 5:00)
Backend APIs with Express.js → endpoints for each prompt type.

MongoDB → storing user/system prompts, logs, and evaluation data.

AI Service → connecting with a model API (like OpenAI) or a mock service.

Middleware → tracking tokens and measuring responses.

Educational Mapping → each API route = one learning concept for prompt engineering.

Closing (5:00)
And that’s the Productive Maker App – MERN Backend.
It’s both a teaching tool and a practical backend for AI-powered productivity apps.
By experimenting with its routes, you’ll not only build hands-on backend skills but also master the art of prompting in Generative AI.

🚀 Thanks for watching, and happy building!
